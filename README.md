## React JS Project with Vite  
  
## Overview  
This project is a modern React application developed using Vite as the build tool. It includes a focus on clean code practices, modularity, and an engaging user interface with support for light and dark theme switching.  

## Features  

- **React Components**: Code refactored into reusable and maintainable React components using JSX.  
- **Light & Dark Theme**: A toggle feature allows users to switch between light and dark themes for an improved user experience.  
- **Visually Appealing UI**: Crafted visually engaging sections to enhance the design aesthetics.  
- **High Performance**: Built with Vite for fast development and optimized builds.  

## Technologies Used  

- **React JS**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
- **Vite**: Fast and modern build tool optimized for front-end development.  
- **JSX**: JavaScript XML for building React components.  
- **Node.js**: For managing dependencies and running the development server.
